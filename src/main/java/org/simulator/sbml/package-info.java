/**
 * Classes for storing and interpreting an
 * <a href="http://sbml.org" target="_blank">SBML</a>
 * model. The most important class is {@link org.simulator.sbml.SBMLinterpreter} that can return the
 * current vector of derivatives to the solver.
 * <p>
 * One important special case of during the simulation of SBML models is dealing with {@link
 * org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint} violation. To this end, this package also provides the interface
 * {@link org.simulator.sbml.ConstraintListener}, which takes a special {@link
 * java.util.EventObject}, namely the {@link org.simulator.sbml.ConstraintEvent} as an argument. The
 * method {@link org.simulator.sbml.ConstraintListener#processViolation(ConstraintEvent)} can then
 * be used to deal with the {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint}. It receives the time, when the {@link
 * org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint}'s condition has been violated together with a reference of the {@link
 * org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint} itself. By default, the {@link org.simulator.sbml.SBMLinterpreter}
 * adds an instance of {@link org.simulator.sbml.SimpleConstraintListener} to its list of {@link
 * org.simulator.sbml.ConstraintListener}s. You can remove this element by calling {@link
 * org.simulator.sbml.SBMLinterpreter#removeConstraintListener(int)} with the argument 0 and add an
 * arbitrary number of user-specific listeners instead. The {@link org.simulator.sbml.SimpleConstraintListener}
 * uses the standard Java {@link java.util.logging.Logger} and displays the time, condition (as
 * formula {@link java.lang.String}), and the message of the {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint} on
 * the log-level {@link java.util.logging.Level#WARNING}. A recommended practice would be maintain a
 * list for each {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint} that gathers all points in time, when it was
 * violated. This list could at the end of the simulation be presented to the user via a graphical
 * user interface together with a rendered version of the message (note that the message element in
 * the {@link org.sbml.jsbml.Constraint} is not a simple text, but an arbitrary XHTML document and
 * therefore not always suitable to be displayed on the console).
