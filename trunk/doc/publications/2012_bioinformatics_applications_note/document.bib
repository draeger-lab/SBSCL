  abstract = {Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend. 
	
	Availability: Source code, binaries, and documentation for JSBML can
	be freely obtained under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 from the website

  abstract = {We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Level 1, Version
	2, a description language for simulations in systems biology. SBML
	is oriented towards representing biochemical networks common in research
	on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic
	pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others.
	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics
	that fall under the umbrella of systems biology and are in the domain
	of the description language defined here. Many contemporary research
	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary
	work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998;
	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,
	2000; Sauro and Fell, 1991), StochSim (Bray et al., 2001; Morton-Firth
	and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML
	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak
	and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema
	that defines SBML Level 1.},

  abstract = {Advances in biotechnology and experimental techniques have lead to

	models provide a method of analysing this data; however, there are
	two issues that need to be addressed: (1) the need for standards
	for defining cell models so they can, for example, be exchanged across
	the World Wide Web, and also read into simulation software in a consistent
	format and (2) eliminating the errors which arise with the current
	method of model publication. CellML has evolved to meet these needs
	of the modelling community. CellML is a free, open-source, eXtensible
	markup language based standard for defining mathematical models of
	cellular function. In this paper we summarise the structure of CellML,
	its current applications (including biological pathway and electrophysiological
	models), and its future development--in particular, the development
