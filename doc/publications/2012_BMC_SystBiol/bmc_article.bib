  title = {Modular rate laws for enzymatic reactions: thermodynamics, sensitivities,
	and implementation},
  journal = {submitted to Bioinformatics},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Motivation: Standard rate laws are key prerequisites for systematically
	turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide
	simple, general, and biochemically plausible formulas for reaction
	velocities and elasticity coefficients. At the same time, they have
	to satisfy various thermodynamic relations that couple the kinetic
	and thermodynamic constants with the metabolic fluxes and concentrations.
	
	Results: We present a family of reversible rate laws designed to describe
	reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various modes of regulation
	in a modular way. They include mass-action, Michaelis-Menten, and
	uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. Thermodynamically
	consistent formulations of these rate laws ensure that the kinetic
	constants will satisfy the thermodynamic Wegscheider conditions and
	Haldane relationships, guaranteeing that parameter sets obtained
	from literature mining, fitting, sampling, or optimisation will lead
	to correct chemical equilibrium states. We show how the chemical
	potential differences act as a thermodynamic driving force and relate
	the modular rate laws to the thermodynamickinetic modelling formalism.
	A reformulation based on parameters called saturation values leads
	to simple formulas for elasticity and control coefficients, which
	reflect the role of thermodynamics. In one of the rate laws, the
	reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity, which therefore
	completely determines the entropy production. To simplify automatic
	processing of the modular rate laws, we propose a standard syntax
	and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML). Availability: An online tool for inserting the rate laws
	into SBML is freely available at www.semanticsbml.org/sbmlfill.

  title = {Bringing metabolic networks to life: convenience rate law and thermodynamic
	constraints},
  journal = {Theor Biol Med Model},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {41},
  number = {42},
  month = {December},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model
	requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions
	depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite
	involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws
	and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes. RESULTS:
	We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics".
	It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic
	laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to
	facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks,
	we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their
	values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical
	constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants
	either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent
	equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover
	rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for
	inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular
	energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme.
	CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical
	network--manually or automatically--into a dynamical model with plausible
	biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation
	by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries,
	and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical
	form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation.
	Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit
	to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants,
	and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays
	and stored in kinetic databases.},

	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics
	that fall under the umbrella of systems biology and are in the domain
	of the description language defined here. Many contemporary research
	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary
	work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998;
	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,
	2000; Sauro and Fell, 1991), StochSim (Bray et al., 2001; Morton-Firth
	and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML
	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak
	and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema
	that defines SBML Level 1.}

  abstract = {Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend.

	is oriented towards representing biochemical networks common in research

	pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others.
	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics
	that fall under the umbrella of systems biology and are in the domain
	of the description language defined here. Many contemporary research
	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary
	work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998;
	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,
	2000; Sauro and Fell, 1991), StochSim (Bray et al., 2001; Morton-Firth
	and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML
	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak
	and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema
	that defines SBML Level 1.}

	is a powerful approach to estimate parameter values, to check the

	It requires high-performance integration of ordinary differential
	equations and robust optimization.We here present the comprehensive
	modeling framework Potters-Wheel (PW) including novel functionalities
	to satisfy these requirements with strong emphasis on the inverse
	problem, i.e. data-based modeling of partially observed and noisy
	systems like signal transduction pathways and metabolic networks.
	PW is designed as a MATLAB toolbox and includes numerous user interfaces.
	Deterministic and stochastic optimization routines are combined by
	fitting in logarithmic parameter space allowing for robust parameter
	calibration. Model investigation includes statistical tests for model-data-compliance,
	model discrimination, identifiability analysis and calculation of
	Hessian- and Monte-Carlo-based parameter confidence limits. A rich
	application programming interface is available for customization
	within own MATLAB code. Within an extensive performance analysis,
	we identified and significantly improved an integrator-optimizer
	pair which decreases the fitting duration for a realistic benchmark
	model by a factor over 3000 compared to MATLAB with optimization
	toolbox.PottersWheel is freely available for academic usage at http://www.PottersWheel.de/.

	simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project
	and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally
	provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication
	is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent
	type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations.
	SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications
	to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures
	to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the
	results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of
	the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent
	format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it
	is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate
	that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively
	exchange executable simulation descriptions.With SED-ML, software
	can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling the validation
	and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools. Authors of
	papers reporting simulation experiments can make their simulation
	protocols available for other scientists to reproduce the results.
	Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s) used,
	experiments covering models from different fields of research can
	be accurately described and combined.},
