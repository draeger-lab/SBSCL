  abstract = {Reproducibility of experiments is a basic requirement for science.
	Minimum Information (MI) guidelines have proved a helpful means of
	enabling reuse of existing work in modern biology. The Minimum Information
	Required in the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) guidelines promote
	the exchange and reuse of biochemical computational models. However,
	information about a model alone is not sufficient to enable its efficient
	reuse in a computational setting. Advanced numerical algorithms and
	complex modeling workflows used in modern computational biology make
	reproduction of simulations difficult. It is therefore essential
	to define the core information necessary to perform simulations of
	those models. The Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment
	(MIASE, Glossary in Box 1) describes the minimal set of information
	that must be provided to make the description of a simulation experiment
	available to others. It includes the list of models to use and their
	modifications, all the simulation procedures to apply and in which
	order, the processing of the raw numerical results, and the description
	of the final output. MIASE allows for the reproduction of any simulation
	experiment. The provision of this information, along with a set of
	required models, guarantees that the simulation experiment represents
	the intention of the original authors. Following MIASE guidelines
	will thus improve the quality of scientific reporting, and will also
	allow collaborative, more distributed efforts in computational modeling
	and simulation of biological processes.},

	at different physiological scales. To do this with computational

	the process of model integration across physiological scales. In
	addition, the VPR has a considerable experimental component and the

	models and made available to the research community. A perspective
	of the current state of the art in model integration and sharing
	along with archiving of experimental data will be presented here
	in the context of multiscale physiological models. It was found that
	current ontological, model and data repository resources and integrative
	software tools are sufficient to create composite models from separate
	existing models and the example composite model developed here exhibits
	emergent behavior not predicted by the separate models.},

	for biochemical networks}},
  journal = {BMC Systems Biology},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {39},
  number = {1},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been
	facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations
	like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
	
	 Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via
	automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone
	and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For
	each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry,
	the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules)
	as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other
	modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions
	between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions.
	The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized
	mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based
	kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics
	allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction
	and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to
	one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
	After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and
	assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner
	or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported
	to SBML, \LaTeX{} or plain text format.
	
	 Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating
	reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for
	reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas
	are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance
	with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously
	published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators
	of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the
	information expressed through the process diagram. Additional material
	and the source code can be found at the project homepage (URL found
	in the Availability and requirements section).},

	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics

	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary

	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,

	and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML
	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak
	and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema
	that defines SBML Level 1.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model
	requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions
	depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite
	involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws
	and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes. RESULTS:
	We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics".
	It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic
	laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to
	facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks,
	we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their
	values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical
	constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants
	either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent
	equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover
	rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for
	inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular
	energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme.
	CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical
	network--manually or automatically--into a dynamical model with plausible
	biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation
	by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries,
	and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical
	form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation.
	Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit
	to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants,
	and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays
	and stored in kinetic databases.},

  journal = {submitted to Bioinformatics},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Motivation: Standard rate laws are key prerequisites for systematically
	turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide
	simple, general, and biochemically plausible formulas for reaction
	velocities and elasticity coefficients. At the same time, they have
	to satisfy various thermodynamic relations that couple the kinetic
	and thermodynamic constants with the metabolic fluxes and concentrations.
	
	Results: We present a family of reversible rate laws designed to describe
	reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various modes of regulation
	in a modular way. They include mass-action, Michaelis-Menten, and
	uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. Thermodynamically
	consistent formulations of these rate laws ensure that the kinetic
	constants will satisfy the thermodynamic Wegscheider conditions and
	Haldane relationships, guaranteeing that parameter sets obtained
	from literature mining, fitting, sampling, or optimisation will lead
	to correct chemical equilibrium states. We show how the chemical
	potential differences act as a thermodynamic driving force and relate
	the modular rate laws to the thermodynamickinetic modelling formalism.
	A reformulation based on parameters called saturation values leads
	to simple formulas for elasticity and control coefficients, which
	reflect the role of thermodynamics. In one of the rate laws, the
	reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity, which therefore
	completely determines the entropy production. To simplify automatic
	processing of the modular rate laws, we propose a standard syntax
	and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML). Availability: An online tool for inserting the rate laws

  abstract = {The newly emerging field of computational cell biology requires software
	tools that address the needs of a broad community of scientists.
	Cell biological processes are controlled by an interacting set of
	biochemical and electrophysiological events that are distributed
	within complex cellular structures. Computational modeling is familiar
	to researchers in fields such as molecular structure, neurobiology
	and metabolic pathway engineering, and is rapidly emerging in the
	area of gene expression. Although some of these established modeling
	approaches can be adapted to address problems of interest to cell
	biologists, relatively few software development efforts have been
	directed at the field as a whole. The Virtual Cell is a computational
	environment designed for cell biologists as well as for mathematical
	biologists and bioengineers. It serves to aid the construction of
	cell biological models and the generation of simulations from them.
	The system enables the formulation of both compartmental and spatial
	models, the latter with either idealized or experimentally derived
	geometries of one, two or three dimensions.},

  abstract = {Modelers in Systems Biology need a flexible framework that allows
	them to easily create new dynamic models, investigate their properties
	and fit several experimental datasets simultaneously. Multi-experiment-fitting
	is a powerful approach to estimate parameter values, to check the
	validity of a given model, and to discriminate competing model hypotheses.
	It requires high-performance integration of ordinary differential
	equations and robust optimization.We here present the comprehensive
	modeling framework Potters-Wheel (PW) including novel functionalities
	to satisfy these requirements with strong emphasis on the inverse
	problem, i.e. data-based modeling of partially observed and noisy
	systems like signal transduction pathways and metabolic networks.
	PW is designed as a MATLAB toolbox and includes numerous user interfaces.
	Deterministic and stochastic optimization routines are combined by
	fitting in logarithmic parameter space allowing for robust parameter
	calibration. Model investigation includes statistical tests for model-data-compliance,
	model discrimination, identifiability analysis and calculation of
	Hessian- and Monte-Carlo-based parameter confidence limits. A rich
	application programming interface is available for customization
	within own MATLAB code. Within an extensive performance analysis,
	we identified and significantly improved an integrator-optimizer
	pair which decreases the fitting duration for a realistic benchmark
	model by a factor over 3000 compared to MATLAB with optimization
	toolbox.PottersWheel is freely available for academic usage at http://www.PottersWheel.de/.
	The website contains a detailed documentation and introductory videos.
	The program has been intensively used since 2005 on Windows, Linux
	and Macintosh computers and does not require special MATLAB toolboxes.Supplementary

  abstract = {CellML is an XML based language for representing mathematical models,
	in a machine-independent form which is suitable for their exchange
	between different authors, and for archival in a model repository.
	Allowing for the exchange and archival of models in a computer readable
	form is a key strategic goal in bioinformatics, because of the associated
	improvements in scientific record accuracy, the faster iterative
	process of scientific development, and the ability to combine models
	into large integrative models.However, for CellML models to be useful,
	tools which can process them correctly are needed. Due to some of
	the more complex features present in CellML models, such as imports,
	developing code ab initio to correctly process models can be an onerous
	task. For this reason, there is a clear and pressing need for an
	application programming interface (API), and a good implementation
	of that API, upon which tools can base their support for CellML.We
	developed an API which allows the information in CellML models to
	be retrieved and/or modified. We also developed a series of optional
	extension APIs, for tasks such as simplifying the handling of connections
	between variables, dealing with physical units, validating models,
	and translating models into different procedural languages.We have
	also provided a Free/Open Source implementation of this application
	programming interface, optimised to achieve good performance.Tools
	have been developed using the API which are mature enough for widespread
	use. The API has the potential to accelerate the development of additional
	tools capable of processing CellML, and ultimately lead to an increased
	level of sharing of mathematical model descriptions.},

  abstract = {The Virtual Cell (VCell; \url{http://vcell.org/}) is a problem solving
	environment, built on a central database, for analysis, modelling
	and simulation of cell biological processes. VCell integrates a growing
	range of molecular mechanisms, including reaction kinetics, diffusion,
	flow, membrane transport, lateral membrane diffusion and electrophysiology,
	and can associate these with geometries derived from experimental
	microscope images. It has been developed and deployed as a web-based,
	distributed, client-server system, with more than a thousand world-wide
	users. VCell provides a separation of layers (core technologies and
	abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms,
	geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This separation
	clarifies the impact of modelling decisions, assumptions and approximations.
	The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial
	modelling and simulation framework. Users create biological models
	and VCell will automatically (i) generate the appropriate mathematical
	encoding for running a simulation and (ii) generate and compile the
	appropriate computer code. Both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
	are supported for describing and running non-spatial simulations;
	a full partial differential equation solver using the finite volume
	numerical algorithm is available for reaction-diffusion-advection
	simulations in complex cell geometries including 3D geometries derived
	from microscope images. Using the VCell database, models and model
	components can be reused and updated, as well as privately shared
	among collaborating groups, or published. Exchange of models with
	other tools is possible via import/export of SBML, CellML and MatLab
	formats. Furthermore, curation of models is facilitated by external
	database binding mechanisms for unique identification of components
	and by standardised annotations compliant with the MIRIAM standard.
	VCell is now open source, with its native model encoding language
	(VCML) being a public specification, which stands as the basis for
	a new generation of more customised, experiment-centric modelling
	tools using a new plug-in based platform.},

	Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes a minimal
	set of information that should be provided to allow the reproduction
	of simulation experiments among users and software tools.In this
	article, we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup
	Language (SED-ML). SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange
	format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of
	simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project
	and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally
	provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication
	is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent
	type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations.
	SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications
	to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures
	to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the
	results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of
	the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent
	format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it
	is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate
	that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively
	exchange executable simulation descriptions.With SED-ML, software
	can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling the validation
	and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools. Authors of
	papers reporting simulation experiments can make their simulation
	protocols available for other scientists to reproduce the results.
	Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s) used,
	experiments covering models from different fields of research can
	be accurately described and combined.},
