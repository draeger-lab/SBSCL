\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:}
        % Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
With the increasing availability of high dimensional time course data for 
metabolites, genes, \COR{and} fluxes\COR{,} the \COR{mathematical} description
of dynamical systems
\sout{by differential equation models becomes more and more popular}
\COR{has become an essential aspect of research}
in systems biology.
%driven by the aim to make biological phenomena predictable. 
Models are often encoded in formats such as \acs{SBML}, whose \sout{mathematical}
structure is very complex and difficult to evaluate due to many special cases.
%A flexible interpreter for \acs{SBML} as well as numerical integrators are hence necessary to solve these models.

\textbf{Results:}
This article describes an efficient algorithm to
\sout{interpret and} solve \sout{differential equation systems in}
\acs{SBML} models\COR{, which are interpreted in terms of ordinary differential equation systems}.
We begin our consideration with a formal representation of the mathematical form
of the models and explain all parts of the algorithm in detail,
including several \COR{preprocessing} steps.  
%Dynamic simulation of models describing biological phenomena is a key aspect of
%research in systems biology. 
%This article describes an efficient and exhaustive algorithm to interpret and
%solve the differential equation systems of models encoded in Systems Biology
%Markup Language (SBML) and its implementation as part of the Systems Biology Simulation Core
%Library for numerical computation in systems biology.
We provide a flexible reference implementation \sout{of the algorithm} as part of the
Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, a community-driven project providing a
large collection of numerical solvers and a sophisticated interface hierarchy 
for the definition of custom differential equation systems. 
To demonstrate the capabilities of the new algorithm, it has been tested with
the entire SBML Test Suite and %also been used to simulate 
all models of BioModels Database.

%
%\section{Supplementary information:}
% TODO: Provide additional material
%Supplementary data is available at Bioinformatics online.
\textbf{Conclusions:}
The formal description of the mathematics behind the \acs{SBML} format facilitates the
implementation of the algorithm within specifically tailored programs.
%The reference implementation (Systems Biology Simulation Core Library) described in this article, reflects this formal structure within its abstract type hierarchy.
The reference implementation can be used as a simulation
backend for Java\texttrademark-based programs. 
%Its abstract type hierarchy allows for customized extension.
%, and can be used on every operating system for which a JVM
%is available.

\section*{Background}

As part of the movement towards quantitative biology, \COR{the} modeling, 
simulation, and computer analysis of biological networks have become integral
parts of modern biological research \cite{Macilwain2011}.
Ambitious national and international research projects such as the Virtual Liver
Network \cite{Holzhuetter2012} strive to derive even organ-wide models of
biological systems that include all kinds of processes taking place at several
levels of detail.
Large-scale efforts like this require \COR{intensive} collaboration between various
research groups, including experimenters\COR{,} modelers\COR{, and bioinformaticians}.
The exchange, storage, interoperability\COR{,} and the possibility to combine models have been recognized as
key aspects of this endeavor \cite{Liebermeister2009sta}.
\TODO{Do we have any other good references for this statement?}

XML-based standard description formats \cite{Bray2000} such as the
\acf{SBML} \cite{Hucka2004} \COR{and} CellML \cite{Lloyd2004}
enable encoding of quantitative biological network models.
To facilitate sharing and reuse of the models, online \COR{databases} such as
\COR{BioModels Database} \cite{Novere2006a} \COR{and} the CellML model repository
\cite{Lloyd2008} provide large collections of published models in various
formats.
Software libraries for reading and manipulating the content
of these formats are also available \cite{Bornstein2008, Miller2010,
Draeger2011b}
\COR{as well as end-user programs supporting these model description languages.}
\sout{and a large variety of programs supports these model description languages}

The models encoded in these formats can be interpreted in terms of 
\COR{several modeling frameworks, including without limitation}
differential equation systems, with additional structures such as
discrete events and algebraic equations.
The diversity of modeling \COR{approaches} and experimental data often requires
customized software solutions for very specific tasks.
\COR{For efficient analysis, simulation, and calibration (e.g.,
the estimation of parameter values) of biological network models a
multiple-purpose and efficient numerical solver library is prerequisite.}
Although the language specifications of \acs{SBML} \cite{Hucka2001, Hucka2003,
Finney2003a, Finney2006, Hucka2007, Hucka2008, Hucka2010a} 
and CellML \cite{Cuellar2006} describe the semantics of models in these formats
and their interpretation, the algorithmic implementation is still not
straightforward.

\COR{The \acs{SBML} community offers} standardized and manually derived benchmark
\COR{tests} in order to evaluate the quality of simulation results, because it
has been recognized that in many cases different solver implementations lead to
divergent results \cite{Bergmann2008}.
%In this work we address the question of how to precisely solve models encoded in
%the \acs{SBML} format, supporting all levels and versions. To this end, we here
%describe a precise solver algorithm.
\COR{The availability of this test suite and the currently much larger variety
of supporting software for \acs{SBML}\footnote{More than 230 available programs
now support the \acs{SBML} data format (April 9\textsuperscript{th} 2013).} in
comparison to CellML are the reasons that}
in this work we
\COR{focus on the simulation of models encoded in the \acs{SBML} format.}
 
\COR{We} address the question of how to precisely interpret \COR{these} models
\sout{encoded in the \acs{SBML} format} \COR{in terms of ordinary differential equation systems}.
Furthermore, we show how to adapt existing \COR{numerical} integration routines
in order to simulate \sout{\acs{SBML}}\COR{these} models.
To this end, we derive a new algorithm for the \COR{accurate} interpretation and 
simulation of \emph{all} currently existing levels and versions of \acs{SBML}.
\sout{As a reference implementation}\COR{To demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm},
we introduce an exhaustive \COR{reference} implementation in \sout{the}
Java\texttrademark{} \sout{programming language}. The algorithm described in this paper
is, however, not limited to any particular programming language.

It is also important to note that the interpretation of these models must be strictly
separated from the numerical method that solves the \COR{implied} differential
equation system. In this way, a similar approach would also be possible for
\COR{other systems biology} community formats\sout{, such as CellML}.
\COR{In particular, the architecture of the reference implementation described
herein has been \emph{ab ovo} designed with the aim to be complemented by a
CellML module.}

%
%The modeling language \acs{SBML} (Systems Biology Markup Language,
%\cite{Hucka2003}) constitutes an important \emph{de facto} standard for the
%exchange of biochemical network models.
%SBML defines a set of data structures and provides rules about how to interpret
%and simulate these kinds of models.
%
%Models in systems biology may combine an ordinary differential equation system,
%which is the basis for numerical simulation, with additional elements such as

It \COR{comprises} several \acf{ODE} solvers and an interpreter for \acs{SBML}
models.

%respect to given time-series of metabolite or gene expression values. 

Furthermore, the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library contains classes to both export
simulation configurations to the \acf{SED-ML} \cite{Waltemath2011},
and facilitate the \COR{reuse} and reproduction of these experiments by executing \acs{SED-ML} files.

\section*{Results and discussion}

\COR{In order to derive an algorithm for the interpretation of \acs{SBML} models in a differential equation framework},
it is first necessary to take a closer look at the mathematical equations implied by this data format.
Based on this general description, we will then discuss all necessary steps
to deduce an algorithm that takes all special cases for the various levels and
versions of \acs{SBML} into account.

\subsection*{A formal representation of models in systems biology}

The mathematical structure of a reaction network comprises a stoichiometric
matrix $\mathbf{N}$, whose rows correspond to the reacting species $\vec{S}$
within the system, whereas its columns represent the reactions, i.e., bio-transformations,
in which these species participate.
The velocities $\vec{\nu}$ of the \COR{reaction channels} $\vec{R}$ determine the rate of
change of the species' amounts:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\D}{\D t}\vec{S} = \mathbf{N}\vec{\nu}(\vec{S}, t, \mathbf{N}, \mathbf{W}, \vec{p})\,.
\label{eq:SpeciesChange}
\end{equation}
The parameter vector $\vec{p}$ contains rate constants and other, often
constant, quantities that influence the reactions' velocities.
According to \cite{Liebermeister2006, Liebermeister2010} the modulation matrix
$\mathbf{W}$ is defined as a matrix of size $|\vec{R}|\times|\vec{S}|$
containing the type of the regulatory influences of the species on
the reactions, e.g., competetive inhibition or physical stimulation.
Integrating equation~(\ref{eq:SpeciesChange}) yields the predicted amounts of the
species at each time point of interest within the interval $[t_0, t_T]$:
\begin{equation}
\vec{S} = \int_{t_0}^{t_T} \mathbf{N}\vec{\nu}(\vec{S}, t, \mathbf{N}, \mathbf{W}, \vec{p})
\D t\,.
\end{equation}
Depending on the units of the species, the same notation can also express the
change of the species' concentrations.
In this simple case, solving the homogeneous ordinary
differential equation system~(\ref{eq:SpeciesChange}) can be done in a
straightforward way using many (numerical) differential equation solvers.
The \COR{nonlinear} form of the kinetic equations in the vector function $\vec{\nu}$
constitutes the major difficulty for this endeavor and is often the reason why
an analytical solution of these systems is not possible or very hard to achieve.
Generally, differential equation systems describing biological networks are,
however, inhomogenious systems with a higher complexity.
Solving systems encoded in \acs{SBML} can be seen as computing the solution of the following
equation:
\ifthenelse{\boolean{publ}}{\begin{multline}
\vec{Q} = \int_{t_0}^{t_T} \mathbf{N}\vec{\nu}(\vec{Q}, t, \mathbf{N}, \mathbf{W},
\vec{p})\D t\\ 
+ \int_{t_0}^{t_T} \vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)\D t + \vec{f}_E(\vec{Q}, t) + \vec{r}(\vec{Q}, t)\,.
\label{eq:QuantityValue}
\end{multline}}{\begin{equation}
\vec{Q} = \int_{t_0}^{t_T} \mathbf{N}\vec{\nu}(\vec{Q}, t, \mathbf{N}, \mathbf{W},
\vec{p})\D t + \int_{t_0}^{t_T} \vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)\D t + \vec{f}_E(\vec{Q}, t) + \vec{r}(\vec{Q}, t)\,.
\label{eq:QuantityValue}
\end{equation}}
The vector $\vec{Q}$ of quantities contains the sizes of the
compartments $\vec{C}$, amounts (or concentrations) of reacting species
$\vec{S}$, and the values of all global model parameters $\vec{P}$.
It should be noted that these models may contain local parameters $\vec{p}$ that
influence the reactions' velocities, but which are not part of the global parameter
vector $\vec{P}$, and hence also not part of $\vec{Q}$.
All vector function terms may involve a delay function, i.e., an expression of 
the form $\mathrm{delay}(x, \tau)$ with $\tau > 0$. In this way, it is possible
to address values of $x$ computed in the earlier integration step at time 
$t - \tau$, turning equation~(\ref{eq:QuantityValue})
into a \acf{DDE}.

In the general case of equation~(\ref{eq:QuantityValue}), not all species' amounts
can be computed by integrating the transformation $\mathbf{N}\vec{\nu}$: The
change of some model quantities may be given in form of rate rules \COR{by}
function $\vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)$ that must be \COR{separately integrated}.
\COR{Species, whose} amounts are determined by rate rules, must not participate \COR{in any
reaction and hence only have} zero-valued corresponding entries in the
stoichiometric matrix $\mathbf{N}$.
Thereby, the rate rule function $\vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)$ directly gives the rate of
change of these quantities, and returns 0 for all others.

In addition, \acs{SBML} introduces the concept of events $\vec{f}_E(\vec{Q}, t)$ and
assignment rules $\vec{r}(\vec{Q}, t)$.
An event can directly manipulate the value of several quantities, for instance,
reduce the size of a compartment to a certain portion of its current size,
as soon as a trigger condition becomes satisfied.
An assignment rule also influences the absolute value of some quantity.

\COR{A further concept in \acs{SBML} are} algebraic rules, which are equations that
must evaluate to zero at all times during the simulation of the model.
These rules can be solved to determine the values of quantities, whose values
are not determined by \COR{any} other construct.
In this way, conservation relations or other complex interrelations can be
expressed in a very convenient way.
With the help of \COR{bipartite} matching \cite{hopcroft1973n} and a subsequent conversion it is possible
to turn algebraic rules into assignment rules and hence include these into the
term $\vec{r}(\vec{Q}, t)$.
Such a transformation, however, requires symbolic computation and is
\COR{thus} a complicated endeavor.

In case that the system under study operates at multiple time scales, i.e., it
contains a fast and a slow \COR{subsystem}, a separation of the system is necessary
leading to \acfp{DAE}.
Some species can be declared to operate at the system's boundaries, assuming a
constant pool of their amounts or concentrations.
Care must also be taken with respect to the units of the species, because under
certain condition\COR{s} division or multiplication with the sizes of their surrounding
compartments \sout{is}\COR{becomes} necessary in order to ensure the consistent interpretation of
the models. 
For all these reasons, solving equation~(\ref{eq:QuantityValue}) is much more 
complicated than computing the solution of the simple equation~(\ref{eq:SpeciesChange})
alone.

From the perspective of software engineering, a strict separation of the 
interpretation of the model and the numerical treatment of the differential
equation system is necessary to ensure that regular numerical methods can be used
to solve equation~(\ref{eq:QuantityValue}).
In order to efficiently compute this solution, multiple \COR{preprocessing} steps are
required, such as the conversion of algebraic rules into assignment rules, or
avoiding repeated \COR{recomputation} of intermediate results.
The next sections will give a detailed explanation of the necessary steps to
solve these systems and how to efficiently perform their numerical integration
with standard numerical solvers.


\subsection*{Initialization}

At the beginning of the simulation the values of species, parameters and compartments are set to the initial values as given in the model.
All \COR{rate laws} of the reactions, assignment rules, transformed algebraic rules (see below), initial assignments, event assignments, rate rules and \COR{function definitions} are integrated into one directed acyclic syntax graph.
This graph is hence the result of merging of the abstract syntax trees representing all those individual elements.
Equivalent elements are only contained once.
This significantly decreases the computation time needed for the evaluation of these syntax graphs during the simulation, in comparison to maintaining multiple syntax trees.
Figure~1 gives an example for such a syntax graph.

After the creation of th\sout{e abstract syntax}\COR{is} graph, the initial assignments and the
assignment rules (including transformed algebraic rules) are processed.
\COR{Initial values defined by initial assignments or assignment rules are computed in this step.}


\subsection*{Solving algebraic rules}
\COR{The most straightforward approach to deal with algebraic rules is to convert them to assignment rules, which can in turn be directly solved.}
In every equation of an algebraic rule, there should be at least one \COR{variable 
whose} value is not yet defined through other equations in \COR{the} model. This variable has to be determined 
for the purpose of interpreting the \COR{algebraic rule}. 
At first, a bipartite graph according to the \acs{SBML} specifications is generated. This graph is used to 
compute a \COR{matching using} the algorithm by Hopcroft and Karp
\cite{hopcroft1973n}. The initial greedy matching is extended with the use of augmenting paths. This process is
repeated until no more augmenting paths can be found. Per definition, this results in a maximal matching. 
As stated in the \acs{SBML} specifications \cite{Finney2006, Hucka2007, Hucka2008, Hucka2010a}, if any equation vertex remains unconnected after augmenting the matching as far as possible, the model is considered overdetermined and thus is not a valid \acs{SBML} model.
\COR{If this is not the case, the mathematical expression of every algebraic rule is thereafter 
transformed into an equation with the target variable on its left-hand side, and hence fulfills the definition of an assignment rule.}
The left-hand side is represented by the respective variable vertex, to which the considered algebraic rule has been matched.
Figure~2 displays the described algorithm in form of a flow chart.


\subsection*{Event handling}
An event in \acs{SBML} is a \COR{list of assignments} that is executed depending on whether a trigger 
condition switches from \false to \true.
In addition, \COR{\acs{SBML} enables modellers to define a delay which may postpone the actual execution of the event's assignments
to a later point in time.}
With the release of \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1, the processing of events has been
raised to a\COR{n even} higher level of complexity\COR{:}
\COR{In earlier versions} it was sufficient to determine, when an event triggers and when its \COR{assignments} are to be \COR{executed}.
In Level~3 Version~1 just a few new language elements have been added\COR{, but these have a huge impact} on how to handle events:
\COR{For example,} the order\COR{,} in which events have been processed\COR{,} used to be at programmer\COR{'}s discretion \COR{in \acs{SBML} Level 2},
but \COR{in Level~3 Version~1} it is given by the event's priority element.
Coordinating the sequence, in which events are to be executed, has now become the crucial part of event handling. 
Furthermore, there exists the option to cancel an event during the time since its trigger 
has been activated and the actual time when the scheduler picks the event for execution.
\COR{Events that can be cancelled after the activation of their triggers are called \emph{nonpersistent}.}

For every time step, the events to be executed are a union of two subsets of the set of all events.
On the one hand, \COR{there are events whose triggers have} been activated at the \COR{current} time and which are to be evaluated without delay.
On the other hand, there are events that triggered at some time point before, and whose delay reaches till the current point in time.
For every element of the resulting set of events their priority rule must be evaluated.
One event is randomly chosen for execution from all events \COR{of} highest priority.
All other events could be handled in the same manner.
However, the assignment of the first event can change the priority or even the trigger condition of the events that have not yet been executed.
Therefore, the trigger of \COR{nonpersistent} events and the priority of the remaining events have to be evaluated again.
In this case, another event that has now the highest priority is chosen.
This process \COR{must be repeated} until no further events are left \COR{for execution}.
Figure~3 shows the slightly simplified algorithm for event processing at a specific point in time.

\COR{The interpretation of events is the most time consuming step of the integration procedure.
This is why efficient and clearly organized data structures are required to ensure high performance of the algorithm}.

\subsection*{Integrated calculation for a certain time step including event processing}
The precise calculation of the \COR{time when} events are triggered\COR{,} is crucial to 
ensure exact results of the numerical integration process.
It could, for instance, happen that an event is triggered at time $t_{\tau}$,
which is between the two integration time points $t_{\tau - 1}$ and $t_{\tau + 1}$.
When processing the events only at time points $t_{\tau - 1}$ and $t_{\tau + 1}$
it might happen that the trigger condition cannot be evaluated to \true at
neither of these time points. 
The Rosenbrock solver \cite{Press1993} can adapt its step size $h$ if events
occur (see \COR{figure~4} for details).
For a certain time interval $[t_{\tau - 1}, t_{\tau + 1}]$ and the current vector
$\vec{Q}$\COR{,} Rosenbrock's method determines the new value of vector $\vec{Q}$ at a
point in time $t_{\tau - 1} + h$\COR{, with $h > 0$}.
If the error tolerance cannot be ensured, $h$ is reduced and the procedure is
repeated.

After that\COR{,} the events and the assignment rules are processed at the new point in
time $t_{\tau - 1} + h$.
If the previous step causes a change in $\vec{Q}$, the adaptive step size is
decreased by setting $h$ to $\nicefrac{h}{10}$ and the calculation is repeated
until \COR{either} the minimum step size is reached or the processing of events and rules
does not change $\vec{Q}$ anymore.
Hence, the \COR{time, at which} an event takes place, is precisely determined.

\subsection*{Calculation of the derivatives for a certain point in time}
For given values $\vec{Q}$ at a point $t$ in time the current vector of derivatives $\dot{\vec{Q}}$ is calculated as follows\COR{.}
First, the rate rules are processed $\dot{\vec{Q}} = \vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)$. Note that function $\vec{g}$ returns 0 in all \COR{dimensions,
in which} no rate rule is defined.
Second, the velocity $\nu_i$ of each \COR{reaction channel} $R_i$ is computed with the help of the unified syntax graph (\COR{figure~1} shows an example of such a graph).
The velocity functions depend on $\vec{Q}$ at time $t$.
During the second step\COR{,} the derivatives of all species that participate in the current reaction $R_i$ need to be updated (see the flowchart in \COR{figure~5}).

\subsection*{A reference implementation of the algorithm \sout{as part of the Systems
Biology Simulation Core Library}}

The algorithm described above has been implemented in Java\texttrademark{} and
included into the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library.
Figure~6 displays \COR{an overview of} the software architecture of this \sout{library}\COR{community project},
which has been designed 
\sout{as part of a community project aiming}
\COR{with the aim}
to provide an extensible numerical backend for customized programs for research in computational systems biology.
The \acs{SBML}-solving algorithm is based on the data structures provided by the JSBML
project \cite{Draeger2008}.
With the help of wrapper classes several numerical solvers originating from the
Apache Commons Math library \COR{\cite{ApacheCommonsMath2013}} could be included into the project.
In addition, the library provides an implementation of the explicit fourth order
Runge-Kutta method, Rosenbrock's solver, and Euler's method.

Each solver has a method to directly access its corresponding \acf{KiSAO} term \cite{Courtot2011}.
Due to the strict separation between numerical differential equation solvers,
and the definition of the actual differential equation system, it is possible to
implement support for \COR{other} community standards, such as CellML
\cite{Lloyd2004}.

In order to support the emerging standard \acf{MIASE} \cite{Waltemath2011a}, the
library also provides an interpreter of \acf{SED-ML} files \cite{Waltemath2011}.
These files allow users to store the details of a simulation, including the
selection and all settings of the numerical method, hence facilitating the
creation of reproducible results.
A simulation experiment can also be directly started by passing a \acs{SED-ML} file to
this interpreter.

Many interfaces, abstract classes, and an exhaustive source code documentation
in form of JavaDoc facilitate the customization of the library.
For testing purposes, the library contains a sample program that benchmarks the
\acs{SBML} interpreter against the entire SBML Test Suite \COR{\cite{SBMLtestSuite2013}}.


\subsection*{Application to published models}

The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library has been tested on all 424 curated
models from \COR{BioModels Database} \cite{Novere2006a} (release~23, October 2012). \COR{All models have been simulated with identical settings
(time interval $[0, 10]$, Rosenbrock's solver, $10^{-6}$ as relative and $10^{-12}$ as absolute tolerance, and a step size of $0.1$ time units).
As a result, all but one (\numero~234) of these models could be simulated without producing an error message. In model \numero~234 the desired tolerance can obviously not be achieved with the given settings. However, the simulation of this model with an error was possible using $10^{-6}$ as relative and $10^{-10}$ as absolute tolerance.}

In the following, we \COR{select} two models \COR{that exhibit diverse features}
from this repository to illustrate the capabilities of this library:
\COR{BioModels Database model \numero~206} by Wolf \emph{et al.} \cite{Wolf2000} and
\COR{BioModels Database model \numero~390} by Arnold 
and Nikoloski \cite{Arnold2011}.

The model by Wolf \emph{et al.} \cite{Wolf2000} mimics glycolytic oscillations
that have been observed in yeast cells.
The model describes how the dynamics propagate through the cellular network
\COR{comprising eleven reactions, which interrelate nine reactive species}.
Figure~7a displays the simulation results for the intracellular concentrations
of 3-phosphogylcerate, \acs{ATP}, glucose, glyceraldhyde 3-phosphate, and 
\acs{NAD$^+$}:
After an initial phase of approximately 15\,s all metabolites begin a
steady-going rhythmic oscillation.
Changes in the dynamics of the fluxes through selected reaction channels within
this model can be seen in \COR{figure~7b}. 

By comparing a large collection of previous models of the Calvin-Benson
cycle, Arnold and Nikoloski created a quantitative consensus model that
comprises eleven species, six reactions, and one assignment rule
\cite{Arnold2011}.
All kinetic equations within this model call specialized function definitions.
Figure~8 shows the simulation results for the species ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate,
\acs{ATP}, and \acs{ADP} within this model.
As in the previous test case, the
\sout{simulation results}\COR{dynamics computed by the Simulation Core Library}
reproduce the \COR{figures} provided by \COR{BioModels Database}.  

\subsection*{Comparison to existing solver implementations for SBML}

In order to benchmark our software, we chose similar tools exhibiting the
following features from the \acs{SBML} software
matrix \TODO{\cite{SBMLsoftwareMatrix2012}}:
%
%\TODO{Many stand-alone programs providing simulation of SBML come with graphical user
%interfaces.
%For instance, the Virtual Cell \cite{Loew2001}, JSim \cite{Beard2012a}, iBioSim 
%\cite{Myers2009}, PottersWheel \cite{Maiwald2008}, COPASI \cite{Hoops2006},
%SYCAMORE \cite{Weidemann2008}, SBToolbox2
%\cite{SBT_Schmidt2006}, JWS Online \cite{Olivier2004}, or the Systems Biology
%Workbench with Roadrunner (SBW, \cite{Bergmann06}). 
%The vast majority of the internal solvers for these systems are part of
%larger software suites and can therefore not be easily integrated into custom
%programs. Some are implemented in programming languages that are either
%platform-dependent (e.g., C or C++) and/or require a commercial license (e.g.,
%MATLAB\texttrademark{}) for their execution.
%The SBML ODE Solver Library \cite{Machne2006}, which is written in C,
%and is based on the libSBML library \cite{Bornstein2008}, 
%provides such a simulation routine based on the \textsc{SUNDIALS} differential equation
%solver.}
%
%We therefore selected only those SBML-capable simulation programs, libraries,
%and frameworks 
%that satisfy the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The last updated version was released after the final release of
  the specification for \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1 Core, i.e., October

  \item Open-source software
  \item No dependency on commercial products that are not freely available
  (e.g., MATLAB\texttrademark{} or Mathematica\texttrademark)
\end{itemize}
The selected programs are in alphabetical order:
%Only three other applications support the simulation of models containing events, algebraic rules and fast reactions completely:
BioUML \cite{Kolpakov2011, Kolpakov2006}, COPASI \cite{Hoops2006}, 
iBioSim \cite{Myers2009, Madsen2012}, JSim \cite{Raymond2003}, LibSBMLSim

Table~1 summarizes the comparison of \COR{the most recent versions of} all six
programs.
\COR{It should be mentioned that this comparison can only mirror a snapshot of
the ongoing development process of all programs at the time of writing.
An up-to-date comparison of the capabilities of SBML solvers can be found online
\cite{Bergmann2013}.}


\subsection*{\COR{Perspective}}

\COR{As mentioned before, Rosenbrock's solver is basically capable of solving stiff \acsp{ODE}. Albeit there are some models from BioModels Database that constitute very stiff problems or large \acsp{ODE} (e.g., the models \numero~235 or \numero~408), for which Rosenbrock's method has some difficulty solving them. In order to maintain the desired accuracy, the solver contineously decreases its step size. As a result, the time consumption for simulation raises. In some cases, tuning the relative and absolute tolerance can help, but depending on the system's structure, Rosenbrock's method is sometimes stretched to its limits.}

\COR{The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method \cite{Fehlberg1970} (\acs{KiSAO} term 86), which is included in iBioSim, shows also an increase in run time concerning the models mentioned above. It should however be mentioned at this point, that  iBioSim does not primary focus on the use of \acs{ODE} solvers, but in the stochastic analysis of systems with the Reb2Sac stochastic simulator and abstraction techniques to make the models easier to analyze.}

\COR{The performance of the methods Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Rosenbrock show, however, that some \acs{ODE} solvers can have more difficulties with some biological models than
more advanced solvers, such as \textsc{CVODE} from \textsc{SUNDIALS} \cite{Hindmarsh2005}, which is incorporated into BioUML. 
\textsc{SUNDIALS} can handle complicated \acsp{ODE} significantly better, but since it is not available under the \acs{LGPL} and currently no open-source Java version of these solvers can be obtained, we disregard its use.
But as a community-driven project, additional solvers can be incorporated into the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library and contribution from the community is welcome.}

\section*{Conclusions}

The \acs{SBML} implementation has successfully passed the
SBML Test Suite (version~2.3.2) \COR{\cite{SBMLtestSuite2013}} using Rosenbrock's solver.
The results are shown in Table~2.
All models together can be simulated within seconds, which means that the simulation
of one \acs{SBML} model takes only milliseconds on average, using regular desktop computers.

The total simulation time for all models in \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1 is significantly
higher than for the models in other \acs{SBML} levels and versions.
This can be explained by the fact that \sout{there are}\COR{the test suite contains}
some models \sout{in \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1}\COR{of this version}, 
\sout{in which}\COR{whose evaluation requires} 
a time-consuming processing of a large number of events\sout{ is necessary}.
In particular, the simulation of model \COR{\numero~}966 of the SBML Test Suite,
which is only provided in \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1, takes 21\,s because it contains 23 events to be processed.
\COR{Two events fire every $10^{-2}$\,s.
These events must therefore be evaluated thousandfold within the specified time interval.}
The evaluation of this model accounts for 60~\% of the total simulation time for the models in \acs{SBML} Level~3 Version~1.
 
Furthermore,
\COR{all}
models from \href{http://biomodels.net}{BioModels} \COR{Database} (release 23,
\cite{Novere2006a})
\COR{have been simulated with identical settings
(time interval $[0, 10]$, Rosenbrock's solver, and a step size of $0.1$ time units)}.
The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library \COR{is able to solve all but one of these models with the given settings. The model producing an error can be simulated with slightly changed settings.}  
These results suggest the reliability of the simulation algorithm described in
this work.

Our tests indicate that \COR{at the moment only two other programs} pass the entire \COR{test suite} for all 
\acs{SBML} levels and versions: BioUML, which is a workbench for modelling, simulation,
and parameter fitting, and \sout{the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library}\COR{iBioSim}.
The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library is therefore the only \acs{API} simulation
library exhibiting this capability.
%Compared to BioUML the Simulation Core Library simulates all models of the Test Suite much faster.
%(see
%\href{http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite}{http://sbml.org/Software/SBML\_Test\_Suite}):

\sout{Therefore}\COR{For these reasons}, the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library is an efficient Java tool
for the simulation of differential equation systems used in systems biology.
It can be easily integrated into larger customized applications.
For instance, \COR{CellDesigner \cite{Funahashi2003} has already been using it since version~4.2}
as one of its \COR{integral} simulation libraries.
The stand-alone application SBMLsimulator \COR{\cite{SBMLsimulator2013}}
provides a convenient graphical user interface for the simulation of \acs{SBML}
models and uses it as a computational back-end.
The abstract class structure of the library supports the integration of \sout{additional}\COR{further} model formats,
such as CellML, \sout{besides}\COR{in addition to} its \acs{SBML} implementation.
To this end, it is only necessary to implement a suitable interpreter class.


%The SBML \acs{ODE} Solver Library \cite{Machne2006}, which is written in C,
%and based on the libSBML library \cite{Bornstein2008}, 
%provides such a simulation routine based on the \textsc{SUNDIALS} differential equation
%solver.

By including support for the emerging standard \acs{SED-ML}, we hope to facilitate the
exchange, archival and reproduction of simulation experiments performed using
the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Implementation}

All the solver classes are derived from the abstract class \AbstractDESSolver (\COR{figure~6}).
Several solvers of the Apache Commons Math library (version 3.0) are integrated with the help of wrapper classes \COR{\cite{ApacheCommonsMath2013}}.
Numerical methods and the actual differential equation systems are strictly separated.
The class \MultiTable stores the results of a simulation within its \Block data structures.

The abstract description of differential equation systems, with the help of several distinct interfaces, makes \COR{it} possible to decouple them from a particular type of biological network. It is therefore possible to pass an instance of an interpreter for a respective model description format to any available solver.
%\marginpar{I would not quote SBML and CellML. CellML is
% actually not supported at the moment}
%
%A specialized interpreter class is required for the evaluation of a biological
%model.
The interpretation of \acs{SBML} models is split between evaluation of events and rules,
computation of stoichiometric information, and computation of the current values for all model components (such as species and compartments).
%
For a given state of the \acs{ODE} system, the class \SBMLinterpreter, responsible
for the evaluation of models encoded in \acs{SBML}\COR{,} returns the current set of
time-derivatives of the variables.
It is connected to an efficient MathML interpreter of the expressions contained
in kinetic laws, rules and events (\ASTNodeInterpreter).
The nodes of the syntax graph for those expressions depend on the current state of the \acs{ODE} system.
If the state has changed, the values of the nodes have to be recalculated (see Results).

%
An important aspect in the interpretation of \acs{SBML} models is the determination of the exact time\COR{,}
at which an event occurs, as this influences the precision of the system's variables.
To this end, we adjusted \COR{an implementation of} the Rosenbrock solver \cite{Kotcon2011},
an integrator with an adaptive step size, to a very precise timing of the events. %\sout{Rosenbrock's method is well-suited even for stiff systems.}
% 
In addition to events, rules are also treated during integration.
Basically, rules are events that occur at every given point in time and are therefore processed in the same manner.
For every object of the type \AlgebraicRule, a new \AssignmentRule object is generated by means of the preceding bipartite matching.
They represent only temporary rules, that are incorporated in the simulation process but do not influence the model in the \acs{SBML} file.
%\marginpar{This is only valid for polynomes. And for those,
%assignmentRules should have been used anyway. How do-you proceed for
%cos(x)=0?: Yes, that's true. People should use assignments there, but the
%AlgebraicRules in the test case are all of the type described here. I am
%currently not sure if we could solve cos(x) = 0 or similar cases.}
%

In the \SBMLinterpreter events are represented via an array containing
\sout{an object}\COR{one instance} of \sout{the class} \EventInProgress for every event in the model.
Thereby\COR{,} the distinction between events with and without delays is made.
\COR{Both types of events can trigger multiple times before being executed.
If no delay is defined, the assignments of the event are usually executed at the same point in time when the event has been triggered.
However, in case that the such an event is cancelled by other events, also all of its assignments are canceled before execution.
An event with delay can produce multiple further assignments within the time interval from being triggered for the first time
and the exeution of its first assignment.}
In order to deal with such an issue, the class \SBMLEventInProgressWithDelay
keeps track of this via the help of a list containing the points in time,
at which the respective event has to executed.
When events trigger more than once before execution,
they have to be ordered according to their delay because the delay of the very same event may vary.

When the \SBMLinterpreter is processing events with priority,
the events with the highest priority are \sout{currently} stored in \COR{a} list
until one of them is selected for \COR{execution}.
\COR{In computer science, the method of choice for the organization of priority
queues like this would apply a well known binary max heap data structure.
The root of the heap represents the largest value in the heap.
After its extraction, the heap property is restored so that the next largest
value is moved to the root. However,}
as stated in Results, the execution of one event can influence the priority \TODO{of} the remaining events.
\TODO{Consider the concept binary max heap: It can possibly happen that many priorities simultaneously change,
whereby the standard method to restore the max heap characteristic after extraction is not sufficient anymore.
For this reason, we disregarded the use of other data structures for the current implementation.}

%
%The simulation algorithm then proceeds as follows: For each time step, the \acs{ODE} %solver gets the current variable values and calculates the system's state for the next point in time. After that, events and rules are processed, that can change the values. The modified values then become the initial values for the next time step. The event processing of the Rosenbrock solver \sout{is different from other solvers, as it} is directly integrated in the solver class and influences the step size. The time-accurate handling of events and rules leads to very precise results of the simulation.
%
\COR{Besides the subset of MathML functions provided by the different \acs{SBML} specifications, there also exists the possibility to apply user-defined functions from a given \acs{SBML} file.
As mentioned in the initialization, additional function definitions are also represented via an abstract syntax graph.
For each function definition the arguments defined in its lambda expression are mapped to their corresponding nodes in the abstract syntax graph.
The evaluation of a MathML element with a user-defined function consists of several steps.
The arguments of the respective function are evaluated and then passed to their corresponding node in the graph via the mapping established before.
After this step the nodes representing arguments have a specific value attached to them.
Finally, the complete abstract syntax graph can be evaluated.}

\COR{During the calculation of reaction velocities the \StoichiometryMath construct allows a dynamic change of a reaction's stoichiometry during simulation.
Since SBML Level~3 Version~1, the stoichiometry of a reaction can be directly altered because it is now possible to address the identifier of a \SpeciesReference as the target variable within rules or events.
The \SBMLinterpreter class flags reactions with changing stoichiometry during initialization and evaluates the corresponding abstract syntax graph anew if the stoichiometry is needed for calculation.}

\COR{The definition of constraints introduces assumptions of how a model is supposed to act during simulation.
Analogous to the trigger of events, the abstract syntax graph of each constraint is evaluated for every time step.
In case of a violation the \SBMLinterpreter generates an instance of \ConstraintEvent that is then processed by the corresponding \ConstraintListener class.
The user is then informed via the standard Java \Logger about the constraint that was violated at which point in time with the message of the corresponding constraint in addition.
More advanced user-defined implementations of \ConstraintListener can be added to the \SBMLinterpreter,
for instance, to notify a \acs{GUI} about violations or display the associated messages in a more user-friendly way.}

\acs{SED-ML} support is enabled by inclusion of the \jlibsedml library \COR{\cite{jlibsedml2013}} in the binary download.
Clients of the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library can choose to use the \jlibsedml \acs{API} directly, or access \acs{SED-ML} support via  facade classes in the \texttt{org.simulator.sedml} package that do not require direct dependencies on \jlibsedml in their code.

\subsection*{Default settings and configuration}

%Points of Control:

\COR{The standard preferences for simulating an SBML model consist of the Rosenbrock
solver with an absolute tolerance of $10^{-12}$ and a relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$.
On the basis of our experiments this setup can handle most of the problems without further ado.
Rosenbrock's solver with its adaptive step size is the most effective solver in this library for stiff \acsp{ODE}.
Nevertheless the user has the possibility the choose another solver for integration.
According to the SBML specifications a model has to be simulated starting at time point 0.0.
Since this library is not limited to \acs{SBML}, the solvers also accept arbitrary start times. 
In any case, the user has the possibility to specify the end of the simulation.
Modifying the relative and absolute tolerance can increase the accuracy of the results or decrease computation time.}

\section*{Figures}

\subsection*{Figure 1 - Example for the creation of an abstract syntax graph of a small model}
\COR{This figure displays a unified representation of kinetic equations from an example model that} consists of the following reactions:
\begin{center}
\parbox[c]{.35\textwidth}{\begin{align*}
R_{1}&:& \textnormal{F1,6BP} &\rightleftharpoons \ce{DHAP} + \textnormal{GA3P}\\
R_{2}&:& \ce{DHAP}   &\rightleftharpoons \textnormal{GA3P}
\end{align*}}
\end{center}
\COR{Both} reactions are part of the glycolysis\COR{. T}he contained molecules are \acf{F1,6BP},
\acf{DHAP}\COR{,} and \acf{GA3P}.
Using the program SBMLsqueezer \cite{Draeger2008} the following mass action kinetics have been created:
\begin{align*}
\nu_{R_{1}} &= k_{+1} \cdot [\textnormal{F1,6BP}] - k_{-1} \cdot[\ce{DHAP}] \cdot [\textnormal{GA3P}]\\
\nu_{R_{2}} &= k_{+2} \cdot [\ce{DHAP}]           - k_{-2} \cdot[\textnormal{GA3P}]
\end{align*}
The nodes for [DHAP] and [GA3P] are only contained in the syntax graph once and connected to more than one multiplication node.
This figure clearly indicates that the syntax graph is not a tree.
\COR{As can be seen in this picture, the outdegree of syntax trees does not necessaryly have to be binary.}

\subsection*{Figure 2 - Algorithm for transforming algebraic rules to assignment rules}
The first step is to decide whether the model is overdetermined by creating a matching of the variables.
If this is not the case, every algebraic rule is solved to the matched variable,
which provides the basis for the creation of an equivalent assignment rule. \TODO{MORE DESCRIPTION!}

\subsection*{Figure 3 - Processing of events: simpflified algorithm (handling of delayed events omitted)}
Let $E$ be the set of all events in a model, and $I_E$ be the set of events, whose trigger
conditions have already been evaluated to \true in the previous time step. We refer to elements within
$I_E$ as \emph{inactive} events. We define the set $A_E$ as the subset of $E$ containing those events,
whose trigger condition switches from \false to \true in the current point $t$ in time. At the beginning
of the event handling, $A_E$ is empty. We call an event \emph{persistent}\COR{,} if it can \TODO{only} be removed from
$A_E$ under the condition that all of its assignments have been evaluated. This means that a
\COR{\emph{nonpersistent}} event can be removed from $A_E$ in case that its trigger condition becomes \false
during the evaluation of other events. Here, the function $\mathrm{trig}(e)$ returns \COR{1 or 0} depending 
on whether or not the trigger condition of event $e \in E$ is satisfied. Similarly, the function
$\mathrm{persist}(e)$ returns \COR{1} if event $e$ is \sout{not} persistent, or \COR{0} otherwise.
In each iteration the trigger conditions of those active events $a_e \in A_E$ that are not persistent are checked.
If the trigger condition of such an event has changed from \true (1) to \false (0), it is removed from $A_E$.
The next step comprises the evaluation of the triggers of all events.
If its trigger changes from \false to \true, an event is added to the set of active events $A_E$.
An event with its trigger changed from \true to \false is removed from the list of inactive events.
After the procession of all triggers the event $e$ of highest priority in the set of active events is chosen for execution by the function $\mathrm{choose}(A_E)$.
Note that priorities are not always defined, or multiple events may have an identical priority. The function $\mathrm{choose}(A_E)$ is therefore more complex than can be shown in this figure.
Th\sout{is}\COR{e selected} event is then processed, i.e., all of its assignments are evaluated, and afterwards the triggers of all events in $E$ have to be evaluated again, because of possible mutual influences between the events.
The algorithm proceeds until the \COR{set $A_E$ of active} events is empty.
\TODO{Should we rename $A_E$ to $E_\mathrm{A}$ and $I_E$ to $E_\mathrm{I}$? If yes, this has also to be done in the images.}

\subsection*{Figure 4 - Integrated calculation of new values for a time step including event processing}
For a certain time interval the Rosenbrock solver \COR{(\acs{KiSAO} term 33)} always tries to increase time $t$ by the current adaptive
step size $s$ and calculates a new vector of quantities $\vec{Q}_{\mathrm{res}}$.
After a successful step the events and rules of the model are processed.
If this causes a change in $\vec{Q}$, $h$ is first decreased and then the Rosenbrock solver calculates another vector $\vec{Q}_{t}$ using this adapted step size.
The precision of the event processing is therefore determined by the minimum step size $h_{\min}$.
The $\mathrm{adapt}$ function is defined by Rosenbrock's method \cite{Press1993}.
\TODO{Should we rename $\vec{Q}_{\mathrm{res}}$ to $\vec{Q}_{\mathrm{next}}$?}

\subsection*{Figure 5 - Calculation of the derivatives at a specific point in time}
First, the vector for saving the derivatives of all quantities $\dot{\vec{Q}}$ is set to the null vector $\vec{0}$.
Then the rate rules of the model are processed by solving the function $\vec{g}(\vec{Q}, t)$, which can change $\dot{\vec{Q}}$ in some dimensions.
After that for every \COR{reaction channel} $R_i$ its velocity $\nu_i$ is computed.
The derivatives of each species (with index $s$) participating in the currently processed \COR{reaction channel} $R_i$ are updated
in each step adding the product of the stoichiometry $n_{is}$ and the reaction's velocity $\nu_i$.
\TODO{Explain that stoichiometric values can be variable! Recomputation is necessary!}
\TODO{Should we note here that in simple cases, in which such a sophisticated step-size adaptation is not required, all available \acs{ODE} solvers can be used, which will be faster?}

\subsection*{Figure 6 - Architecture of the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (simplified)}
Numerical methods are strictly separated from differential equation systems. The
upper part displays the unified type hierarchy of all currently included numerical integration
methods. The middle part shows the interfaces defining several
special types of the differential equations to be solved by the numerical
methods.
The class \SBMLinterpreter (bottom part) implements all of these interfaces
with respect to the information content of a given \acs{SBML} model. Similarly, an
implementation of further data formats can be included into the
library.
\TODO{Why does Rosenbrock not extend FirstOrderSolver?}

\subsection*{Figure 7 - Simulation of glycolytic oscillations}
This figure displays the results of a simulation computed with the Systems
Biology Simulation Core Library based on model \COR{\numero} 206 from BioModels \COR{Database}
\cite{Novere2006a, Wolf2000}.
Shown are the changes of the concentration (7a) of the most characteristic
intracellular metabolites 3-phosphogylcerate, \acs{ATP}, glucose, \acf{GA3P},
and \acs{NAD$^+$} within yeast cells.
Figure~7b displays a selection of the dynamcis of relevant fluxes 
(\textsc{d}-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, glycerone-phosphate-forming,
phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, acetaldehyde forming,
\acs{ATP} biosynthetic process)
that were computed as intermediate results by the algorithm.
The computation was performed using the Adams-Moulton solver \cite{Hairer2000}
(\acs{KiSAO} term 280) with 200 integration steps, $10^{-10}$ as absolute error
tolerance and $10^{-5}$ as relative error tolerance.
Due to the importance of feedback regulation the selection of an appropriate
numerical solver is of crucial importance for this model.
Methods without step-size adaptation, such as the fourth order Runge-Kutta
algorithm (\acs{KiSAO} term 64), might only be able to find a high quality solution 
with an appropriate number of integration steps. 
The simulation results obtained by using the algorithm described in this work
reproduces the results provided by \COR{BioModels Database}.
\TODO{Where are these results provided?}
\TODO{Add more information about the number of species and reactions etc. in the model.}

\subsection*{Figure 8 - Simulation of the Calvin-Benson cycle}
Another example of the capabilities of the Simulation Core Library has been
obtained by solving model \COR{\numero} 390 from BioModels \COR{Database} 
\cite{Novere2006a, Arnold2011}.
This model was simulated using Euler's method (\acs{KiSAO} term 30) with 200
integration steps for the time interval $[0, 35]$ seconds.
This figure shows the evolution of the concentrations of ribulose 1,5
bisphosphate\COR{, a key metabolite for \ce{CO2} fixation in the reaction catalzed by \acf{RuBisCO},} and the currency metabolites \acs{ATP} and \acs{ADP} during the first 35\,s of
the photosynthesis.

\section*{Tables}

\subsection*{Table 1 - Comparison of SBML-capable simulators}
The table gives an overview about the most characteristic features of
\acs{SBML}-capable simulation programs. As one aspect, it shows, which programs
support the most difficult \acs{SBML} elements (fast reactions, algebraic rules, and
events). Another key point is whether all models of the most recent SBML Test
Suite \COR{\cite{SBMLtestSuite2013}} can be correctly solved.
Please note that in the column for the SBML Test Suite, a dash means that
\emph{not all} of its models can be correctly solved, because not all \acs{SBML}
elements are supported.
\COR{In its current version, t}he program iBioSim, for instance, solves the vast
majority of the test cases correctly, but does not yet support the delay function,
except delayed events.
LibSBMLSim, which is a simulation \acs{API} written in C, can only read models given
in \acs{SBML} Level~2 Version~4 and \acs{SBML} Level~3
\COR{(indicated by the checkmark in brackets)}.
Similarly, a dash in the column for events means that not \emph{all} possible
cases for this language element can be correctly solved.
COPASI, for instance, supports events in \acs{SBML}, but not all of the current 
constructs.
Hence, Systems Biology Simulation Core Library and BioUML are the only
simulation tools from this selection that pass \emph{all} models of the SBML
Test Suite \COR{(version~2.3.2)} across all levels and versions of \acs{SBML}.
\TODO{This table must be updated!}
